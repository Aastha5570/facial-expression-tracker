pushing all code through html file, as i found this much easy to do it 
rather than creating lots of files, why not create one? yuppp, i did this all in one file only 
upto you guys.. if you're comfortable with creating different files and writing each models seperately so YESSS you can 

THANK YOU SO MUCH!! 
will see you soon with another interesting project
